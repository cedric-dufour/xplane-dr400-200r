(Open Source and GPL for Dummies)

This software is open source and licensed under the GNU General Public License,
version 3 (GPLv3); see the COPYRIGHT, AUTHORS and associated LICENSE files.

This means you can FREELY:
 - Copy it
 - Use it
 - Modify it
 - Request your modifications to be "pulled" back into "upstream" (nice!) and
   be added to the list of AUTHORS.
 - Distribute your modified version independently from "upstream" (less nice)

PROVIDED you respect the original COPYRIGHT and associated LICENSE!

This means you MAY NOT (in particular):
 - Change the COPYRIGHT or the associated LICENSE without the agreement of all
   the AUTHORS. This would be a VIOLATION of the LICENSE (GPLv3, art.4 and 5)
   and intellectual property laws (e.g. the Swiss "Loi sur le droit d'auteur",
   LDA, RS 231.1).
 - Distribute the "upstream" or your modified version without its source code,
   including that of your modifications. This would be a VIOLATION of the
   LICENSE (GPLv3, art.5 and 6)!
 - Pick only pieces of this software - be it "upstream" or a modified version -
   and feel this absolves you from respecting the forementioned COPYRIGHT and
   associated LICENSE.

Although you MAY:
 - Add "Additional permissions" to YOUR contribution(s), as provisioned by
   the LICENSE (GPLv3, art.7), without infringing the COPYRIGHT and the
   associated LICENSE.

Bottom-line and shortly put:
This software is open source and licensed under the GNU General Public License,
version (GPLv3); PLEASE KEEP IT THAT WAY!
