X-Plane Flight Model vs Realism
===============================

In order to reproduce the aircraft behavior and performances as accurately as
possible, the following "unit tests" have been used, based on the actual (real
life) experience of the given aircraft.

Bear in mind reaching the highest possible realism is a not a straight-forward
approach. A lot of back-and-forth adjustements of the X-Plane Plane Maker
settings will be required to reach one's objective.


In general
----------
  S: Set (in Simulator)
  H: Plane Maker hint

* Airfoils
  DO use Wings and Propeller airfoils that match reality!
  H: Airfoils > ...

* Atmosphere
  DO set weather to NO WIND and TEMPERATURE/PRESSURE conditions that
  match actual experience (airport ALTITUDE).
  S: LSGS (Sion), 1582ft, 20°C, QNH 1013

* Weight and Balance
  DO set the aircraft WEIGHT and BALANCE to match actual experience.
  X-Plane automatically adjusts the balance according to the fuel weight
  but it does NOT do so for other payload (passengers and luggages).
  S: Weight and Balance > Payload Weight
     Weight and Balance > Center of Gravity

* Data Output vs Panel Instruments
  BEWARE of custom panel instruments which readings do NOT match
  actual X-Plane Data Output values! Make sure to use the latter as
  reference and take the opportunity to correct panel instruments
  mismatch!
  H: Panel 2D/3D > Generic Instruments > Key Frames
